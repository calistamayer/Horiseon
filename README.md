# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description

The objective of this weekly challenge was to refactor source code from Horiseon (a marketing agency) to meet accessibility standards. 

The finished product is a simple, accessible website - it has a descriptive and concise title, sequential header elements, operative links and alt tags for images. Compared to the source code, it is better optimized for both search engines and differently abled users. 

In the process of working on this project, I: 
1. fixed a link in the header's navigation bar by establishing the identity of its corresponding section
1. cleaned up the style sheet by consolidating multiple classes that had identical same set of declarations and could apply to a more general group of divs (i.e. the "content sections")
1. added alt tags for the site's images
1. re-organized the stylesheet so the rules are ordered based on how the appear on the webpage itself
1. corrected the header sequence so as not to skip any header levels
1. added CSS comments for readability
1. pushed the project to GitHub for live viewing
1. created this README.

The webpage looks like:
